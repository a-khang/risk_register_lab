# risk_register_lab

## Overview
A risk register is used to document identified risks which an organization faces.

These risks are sorted by severity and likelihood to determine an organization's risk management priorities.

Here are some fundamental ideas that underscore what we are talking about today:
- Risk exposure is inevitable, and because we can't realistically avoid all risk, we need a risk management strategy that aligns with our risk tolerance and strategic goals.
- With limited resources, we cannot afford to prevent all risks to which we are exposed.
