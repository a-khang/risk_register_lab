# Understanding the Risk Register

## Risk Concepts
Here are some fundamental risk concepts that underscore what we are talking about today:
- Risk exposure is inevitable, and because we can't realistically avoid all risk, we need a risk management strategy that aligns with our risk tolerance and strategic goals.
- With limited resources, we cannot afford to prevent all risks to which we are exposed.

In terms of cybersecurity risk management, we know a few things:
- An organization's security operations form a cost centre: resources are constrained, so there needs to be a focus on cost reduction. Security personnel should focus on mitigating threats that pose significant risks to the organization.
- Threats that pose negligible risks should not be pursued as they can occupy security efforts that could be utilized to prevent and handle potentially catastrophic threats.

## Understanding the Risk Register

A risk register is used to document **identified** risks which an organization faces. These risks are sorted by severity and likelihood to determine an organization's risk management priorities.

### NIST CSF Context
The first element of the CSF core (regardless of whether you use NIST CSF 1.0 or 2.0) is _Identify_, provided in the excerpt below:
> IDENTIFY (ID) — The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood.
Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks **enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the mission needs identified** under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures, and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six Functions.


To take a look at what a risk register looks like, let's run a Google Dork to find an .xls template used by the government.

We see that the first result returns an Enterprise Risk Register Template provided by the B.C. Government.
