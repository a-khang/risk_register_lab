# Risk Register Lab

## Objectives
1. Demonstrate risk management skills: 
- Identification
- Scoring
- Documentation
- Assigning Ownership
2. Use Excel to create a risk register.

## Scenario
A small healthcare SaaS startup that is building a patient dashboard app needs a basic risk management framework to support HIPAA compliance.

## Recommended Framework
NIST CSF is a scalable, flexible risk-based framework that maps well to external and regulatory requirements pertaining to security, including HIPAA. Using the framework allows startups to tailor a security roadmap, and develop/grow controls based on their size, maturity, and risk exposure. The emphasis on risk in a GRC program makes it more suitable to take on new compliance requirements beyond the current peripheral of the organization.

Approach: Use NIST CSF as the anchoring security framework for risk-depth, and map it to HIPAA for compliance. These are the two lenses for the same risk.

Integrate with NIST SP 800-30 (Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments) for building the risk register.

## How to view NIST CSF and HIPAA
Map the CSF's 6 functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, Govern) to HIPAA safeguards.
- Each CSF function has categories and subcategories. A risk will match to one or more of these categories.
- HIPAA contains two relevant rule sets: Security Rule (referring to safeguards) and Privacy Rule (use/disclosure of PHI).
- HIPAA will specify a recommendation for implementing controls based on the risk specified with NIST CSF.

## Steps
Begin by using NIST SP 800-30 as the template for the risk register. Define the scope and identify assets.

Next, identify threats and vulnerabilities. Also assess/score each risk by determining the product of likelihood and impact.

Then, map the risk to HIPAA and NIST CSF.

Lastly, recommend controls.
