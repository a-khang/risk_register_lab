# Understanding the Risk Register

## Risk Concepts
Here are some fundamental risk concepts that underscore what we are talking about today:
- Risk exposure is inevitable, and because we can't realistically avoid all risk, we need a risk management strategy that aligns with our risk tolerance and strategic goals.
- With limited resources, we cannot afford to prevent all risks to which we are exposed.

In terms of cybersecurity risk management, we know a few things:
- An organization's security operations form a cost centre: resources are constrained, so there needs to be a focus on cost reduction. Security personnel should focus on mitigating threats that pose significant risks to the organization.
- Threats that pose negligible risks should not be pursued as they can occupy security efforts that could be utilized to prevent and handle potentially catastrophic threats.

## Understanding the Risk Register

A risk register is used to document **identified** risks which an organization faces. These risks are sorted by severity and likelihood to determine an organization's risk management priorities.

### Context with Information Security
For some additional context, we can consult the core of NIST's Cybersecurity Framework to see where this tool is used.



To take a look at what a risk register looks like, let's run a Google Dork to find an .xls template used by the government.

We see that the first result returns an Enterprise Risk Register Template provided by the B.C. Government.
