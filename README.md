# Risk Register Lab

## Objectives
1. Demonstrate risk management skills: 
- Identification
- Scoring
- Documentation
- Assigning Ownership

2. Use Excel to create a risk register.

## Scenario
A small healthcare SaaS startup that is building a patient dashboard app needs a basic risk management framework to support HIPAA compliance.

## Recommended Framework
NIST CSF is a risk-based framework that maps well to external and regulatory requirements pertaining to security, including HIPAA. It assesses the current security posture, and assists in defining a roadmap based on security objectives tied to the 6 core functions of NIST CSF.

The framework also provides scalability, allowing startups to tailor controls based on their size, maturity, and risk exposure. 

Effectively, the startup can balance security and compliance with other business objectives pertaining to growth and potential acquisitions.
